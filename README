The goal of this project is to develop simple scripts to better learn cryptography techniques.

1) Stream ciphers:
-----------------
EXP[1] Danger with many time pad stream cipher: Problem with using the same stream cypher key multiple times. 
- CypherText.py: This script will help you to generate keys and cypher texts
- CryptoUtils.py: This script will provide you tools and experiments to analyse the cypher. 

EXP[2] Brute-force attack or exhaustive key search: Analyze a weak PRG whose output can be predicted in roughly 2^28 time.
- WeakPRG.py: With random seeds, each 28 bits, this algorithm will output 9 psuedo-random numbers.
- BreakPRG.py: This experiment will predict it's 10th output in roughly 2^28 time.
