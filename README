The goal of this project is to develop simple scripts to better learn cryptography techniques.

1) Stream ciphers:
-----------------
EXP[1] Danger with many time pad stream cipher: Problem with using the same stream cypher key multiple times. 
- CypherText.py: This script will help you to generate keys and cypher texts
- CryptoUtils.py: This script will provide you tools and experiments to analyse the cypher.
